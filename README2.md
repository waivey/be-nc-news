# NC Backend Project News

**This is a project on creating endpoints for a news website and working with a database**

## Getting Started

To be able to have a play with this repo, you'll need Knex to interact with your PSQL database, as well as Express for dealing with the server.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following software to get going

```
Express
Knex
Postgres
```

and these will just be for development

```
Chai
Chai-sorted
Mocha
Supertest
```

### Installing

Get your development env up and running.
You could most likely do

```npm i

```

and have all your dependencies downloaded, but if you'd like to be thurough, and do them one at a time, you can do the following:

```
npm i express
```

```
npm i knex
```

```
npm i pg
```

And don't forget the dev dependencies!

```
npm i mocha -D
```

```
npm i chai -D
```

```
npm i chai-sorted -D
```

```
npm i supertest -D
```

Yay! Everything should now be installed and ready to roll.

Because there's a lot going on between Knex, Pg, and the test files (because you should _always_ test your code!), and the commands would be long and unruly, there are some handy scripts you can use!
